# VDJscriptTranslatorBackend

requires npm to work!

This is the backend that grabs the mapping xml file, translates it to json, and sends it on to the frontend.

To configure it for you, go into index.js and change the "mapfilelocation" to match the location of the target map file.

Then, run "npm i" to install the required packages, and "npm start" to run the backend.
